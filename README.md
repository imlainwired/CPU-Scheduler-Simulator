## 🔌 CPU Sheduling Simulator:
A console-based CPU Scheduling Simulator written in C++. It allows users to input process details such as arrival time, burst time, priority, and time quantum (where applicable). The simulator visually demonstrates process execution through a step-by-step simulation bar and presents a detailed summary table at the end. It also includes a comparison mode to analyze the behavior and performance of multiple scheduling algorithms in a clear and readable console output.

## 🛰 Implemented Scheduling Algorithms:
1.  Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
2.  First-Come, First-Served (Non-Preemptive)
3.  Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
4.  Shortest Remaining Time First (Preemptive)
5.  Round Robin (Preemptive)
6.  Compare All Algorithms
